**This repository contains the game day package.**

**How to Install Package**
First install devtools if you don't already have it. Then type in R, 

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("kenlau177/gameday")
library(gameday)
```

**How it works**
There are 2 functions in this package:
- **gday**: Determines whether an NHL team has a game given the day
- **scores**: Presents information of all the games and scores for a particular day.

You can view the documentations of these two functions by: 
- ?gday
- ?scores

Examples:
```{r}
gday(team="Canucks", gDate="2014-11-19")
scores(gDate="2014-11-16")
```
